I am just following up on your "Interactive Overview" response from this where you weren't able to say that you were confident with the material.  That is totally fine, and I appreciate your honesty.  I just wanted to reach out and ask if there's anything I can help with to increase that confidence level.

I hope all is well.

Best,
Drew
