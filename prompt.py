Great work with your initial post!  The only deduction this week was because your replies did not all meet the minimum word/substance requirement.  Remember replies should be at least 75 words in length and contain mathematical substance that pushes the conversation forward.  I combined your two posts to give you credit for one reply.

Your initial post was a little light on content and word count, but I did give you credit for it.  Make sure it meets the 175 word count for subsequent weeks.
